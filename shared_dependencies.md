1. **React**: All the files in the "src" directory will share the React library as a dependency. This includes the use of React components, hooks, and JSX.

2. **Firebase**: The "src/firebase.ts" file will export the initialized Firebase app, which will be used in "src/hooks/useAuth.ts" for authentication, and potentially in other components for database operations.

3. **User Type**: The "src/types/User.ts" file will define a User type (likely an interface in TypeScript) that will be used across multiple files, such as "src/hooks/useAuth.ts" and possibly the various component files for prop types.

4. **Authentication Hooks**: The "src/hooks/useAuth.ts" file will export custom hooks related to authentication (like useAuth, useSignIn, useSignOut) that will be used in "src/components/Login.tsx", "src/components/SignUp.tsx", "src/components/AuthenticatedApp.tsx", and "src/components/UnauthenticatedApp.tsx".

5. **DOM Element IDs**: The "src/components/Login.tsx" and "src/components/SignUp.tsx" files will likely share DOM element IDs for form inputs (like "email", "password") that will be used in the authentication hooks.

6. **Global Styles**: The "src/styles/global.ts" file will export global styles that will be used in "src/App.tsx" and potentially other component files.

7. **App Components**: The "src/App.tsx" file will import and use the "AuthenticatedApp" and "UnauthenticatedApp" components from "src/components/AuthenticatedApp.tsx" and "src/components/UnauthenticatedApp.tsx" respectively.

8. **Package.json**: This file will contain all the dependencies for the project, which will be shared across all files.

9. **tsconfig.json**: This file will contain the TypeScript configuration, which will be used across all TypeScript files in the project.
